      <p>
        Hi, I’m Nikitha. I like learning new things, thinking a lot, and exploring ideas at my own pace.
        I enjoy good stories, taking pictures, spending time with nature, listening to music, learning tech and coding.
        Just figuring things out as I go.

        <h3>Past</h3>

        <p><strong>Where I began</strong></p>

        <p>
            I started my academic journey from "Doveton oakley" and "Doveton Girls Hr. Sec. School (ICSE)" with a focus on building a strong academic foundation while gradually
            discovering my interest in creativity. During this time, i developed my interest on speaking with accent in english. I've done my schooling in "Everwin Vidhyasharam CBSE" and I scored 94.2% in my 10th grade and scored 89.4% in 12th grade CS-group 
        </p>


      <div class="glass-card">
        <h3>Present</h3>
          <p><strong>Where I am now</strong></p>
          <p>
              
          </p>Right now, I'm pursuing BS Data science and applications in "Indian Institute of Technology Madras (IIT-M)" and "B.E. CSE in "Velammal institute of technology".
          I am in a phase of exploration and self-learning, spending time understanding technology, creativity, and problem-solving.
          I like taking things step by step, learning through practice, and allowing myself the space to grow without rushing the process.
          </p>


      <div class="glass-card">
        <h3>Future</h3>
          <p><strong>Where I’m headed</strong></p>
          <p>
              My goal is to continue developing my technical and creative skills while working on 
              projects that challenge and inspire me. I want to grow into opportunities where I can 
              contribute, learn continuously, and shape ideas into impactful digital solutions.
